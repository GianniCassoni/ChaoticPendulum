# ChaoticPendulum

This project explores the application of the Lyapunov Characteristic Exponent (LCE) to analyze the chaotic behavior of a pendulum system using CUDA for parallel computing

## Overview

The Lyapunov Characteristic Exponent is a measure of the average rate at which nearby trajectories in a dynamical system converge or diverge. A positive Lyapunov exponent indicates chaos, while a negative exponent suggests stability. This project implements a numerical simulation to compute the LCE for a chaotic pendulum, leveraging the power of CUDA to accelerate the computations.

## Features

- **CUDA Acceleration**: The application utilizes NVIDIA's CUDA platform to perform parallel computations, significantly speeding up the simulation process.
- **Visualization**: Results are visualized to illustrate the chaotic behavior of the pendulum and the computed Lyapunov exponents.
- **Open Source**: All code is available for review and modification. Contributions are welcome!

## Current Status

The project is still in progress, and several features are yet to be implemented. Future updates will include:

- Enhanced visualization tools for better representation of chaotic dynamics.
- Additional parameters for the pendulum system to explore different chaotic regimes.
- Comprehensive documentation and examples for users to easily understand and utilize the code.

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements or new features, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
